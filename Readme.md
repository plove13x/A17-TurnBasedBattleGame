Turn-Based Battle Game
====================
This one was fun. My skills have come a long way since I made it and there are some aspects I would code differently if I did it all over again, but back in the day I used to love playing Final Fantasy RPGs, so writing damage algorithms for the first time and then experiencing my dynamic gameplay come to life during testing was definitely rewarding. If you think you're up for the challenge, watch out for Jaws - he's tough!
